This repository contains code used in the analysis for the manuscript **Anthropogenic habitat disturbance data does not improve predictions of red wood ant occurrence across Swiss forests**.

The supplementary materials S1 to S9 of this manuscript are the compiled versions of the files `S1...Rmd` to `S9...Rmd` in this repository.
These files detail the data preparation and model interpretation.

The remainder of the code written to conduct the analysis exists as a sequence annotated R code files in the folder `party` named after the R package used for fitting the conditional inference forests used in this analysis.

All R code was run using R version 3.5.1.
All R packages used are listed in the [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) lock file included in this repository.
