This repository contains code used in the analysis for the manuscript **Predictions of Red Wood Ant Occurrence across Swiss Forests Unimproved by Descriptions of Anthropogenic Habitat Disturbance**.

The appendices to this manuscript detail the data preparation and model interpretation.

The remainder of the code written to conduct this analysis exists as a sequence annotated R code files contained in the folder `party' named after the R package used for fitting the conditional inference forests used in this analysis.

All R code was run using R version 3.5.1.
All R packages used are listed in the [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) lock file included in this repository.
